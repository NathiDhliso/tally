# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the Voice-to-Invoice application from a functional MVP into a futuristic, cutting-edge AI companion experience. The overhaul introduces glassmorphism design patterns, fluid 3D interactions, ambient animations, and a voice-first companion-like feel that represents 2025 aesthetics. The goal is to create a "wow factor" on first load while maintaining 60fps performance and ensuring the experience feels like interacting with an intelligent AI assistant rather than a traditional form-based application.
