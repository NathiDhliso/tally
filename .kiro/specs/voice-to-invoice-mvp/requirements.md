# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Voice-to-Invoice MVP is a mobile-first web application designed for South African small businesses, freelancers, and consultants to create professional invoices in seconds using voice input. The system captures voice recordings, transcribes them using AI, extracts invoice details with confidence scoring, and generates professional PDF invoices in South African format with VAT compliance.

The application prioritizes speed (10-20 second end-to-end target), ease of use (single-tap voice recording), and flexibility (manual entry fallback). It supports both anonymous local-only usage and optional cloud sync with AWS infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Voice Recording and Audio Capture

**User Story:** As a small business owner, I want to record invoice details by speaking naturally into my device, so that I can create invoices quickly without typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the microphone button THEN the system SHALL request microphone permissions with a clear privacy message
2. WHEN microphone access is granted THEN the system SHALL start recording audio with visual feedback (pulsing animation, timer, audio level meter)
3. WHEN the user taps the microphone button again THEN the system SHALL stop recording and begin processing
4. WHEN recording duration exceeds 90 seconds THEN the system SHALL display a countdown indicator
5. WHEN recording reaches 2 minutes THEN the system SHALL automatically stop and begin processing
6. IF microphone permission is denied THEN the system SHALL display an error modal with platform-specific instructions and offer manual entry as fallback
7. IF microphone hardware is not detected THEN the system SHALL hide the voice button and show manual entry as primary input
8. WHEN the user long-presses the microphone button for 500ms THEN the system SHALL display an overlay with "Recent Clients" and "Type Instead" options
9. WHEN recording fails due to browser incompatibility THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to manual entry mode
10. WHEN audio is captured THEN the system SHALL compress the file to 50-70% of original size before upload

### Requirement 2: Voice Transcription with AI

**User Story:** As a user, I want my voice recording to be accurately transcribed into text, so that the system can extract invoice details from what I said.

#### Acceptance Criteria

7. IF network timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL save recording locally and display "Recording saved locally. Tap to retry upload."
8. IF API quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL display "Daily limit reached. Upgrade to Pro or try again tomorrow."
9. WHEN transcription completes THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger invoice data extraction
10. WHEN audio file is processed THEN the system SHALL schedule deletion after 24 hours unless user has enabled voice retention

5. IF confidence score is 70-90% THEN the system SHALL auto-fill the field with yellow border and display confidence percentage
6. IF confidence score is below 70% THEN the system SHALL leave field empty with "[unclear]" placeholder and red border
