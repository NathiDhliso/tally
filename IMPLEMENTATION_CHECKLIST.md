## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise

#### Option 1: Quick Fix
If minor issues, fix and redeploy:
```bash
# Fix the issue
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue"
git push
# Redeploy
```

#### Option 2: Revert to Old Version
If major issues, revert to multi-page version:

1. Update `src/App.tsx`:
```typescript
// Change this:
import { HomePageUnified } from './pages';
<Route index element={<HomePageUnified />} />

// To this:
import { HomePage } from './pages';
<Route index element={<HomePage />} />
<Route path="invoice/review" element={<InvoiceReviewPage />} />
```

2. Redeploy:
```bash
git commit -m "revert: use original HomePage"
git push
```

#### Option 3: Feature Flag
Implement feature flag to toggle between versions:
```typescript
const USE_UNIFIED_EXPERIENCE = process.env.REACT_APP_UNIFIED_UX === 'true';

<Route index element={USE_UNIFIED_EXPERIENCE ? <HomePageUnified /> : <HomePage />} />
```

## Known Issues

### None Currently
All known issues have been resolved. The implementation is production-ready.

### Potential Future Issues
- **Scroll conflicts:** Gesture might conflict with scroll on some devices
  - **Solution:** Gesture only triggers when scrolled to top
- **Performance on old devices:** Animations might lag
  - **Solution:** Respects reduced motion preference
- **Browser compatibility:** Older browsers might not support all features
  - **Solution:** Graceful degradation with fallbacks
