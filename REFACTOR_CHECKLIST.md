2. [ ] Add light mode support
3. [ ] Create theme switcher component
4. [ ] Add more dev data samples

### Short Term
1. [ ] Integrate with backend API

## üéì Knowledge Transfer

### For New Developers
1. Read `SEMANTIC_THEMING_REFACTOR.md` first
2. Check `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for patterns
3. Use `BEFORE_AFTER_COMPARISON.md` for examples
4. Reference `HomePageUnified.tsx` for implementation

### For Designers
1. All colors defined in `tailwind.config.js`
2. Semantic tokens describe purpose, not appearance
3. Easy to create new themes
4. Consistent design language enforced

### For QA
1. Use `window.devData.clear()` to test empty states
2. Use `window.devData.seed()` to reset data
3. Visual appearance should be identical
4. All functionality should work as before

## üìù Notes

### Lessons Learned
1. Semantic naming is crucial for maintainability
2. Utility classes reduce code duplication
3. Centralized data makes testing easier
4. Single source of truth prevents inconsistencies
5. Good documentation saves time

### Best Practices
1. Always use semantic tokens, never hardcode colors
2. Create utility classes for common patterns
3. Keep dev data separate from production code
4. Document architectural decisions
5. Test thoroughly after refactoring

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. Don't mix old and new approaches
2. Don't remove non-color classes accidentally
3. Don't change component behavior
4. Don't skip testing
5. Don't forget to update documentation
