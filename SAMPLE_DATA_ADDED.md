# Sample Data Added âœ…

## Issue Resolved

The pages **DO have content** - they were just showing **empty states** because the stores started with no data. This is the correct behavior for a fresh application.

## Empty State Behavior

The pages are designed to show **beautiful empty states** when there's no data:

### InvoicesPage Empty State
- Icon: Document icon
- Title: "No invoices"
- Description: "Get started by creating a new invoice."
- Action: "Create Invoice" button

### ClientsPage Empty State
- Icon: Users icon
- Title: "No clients yet"
- Description: "Add your first client to get started."
- Action: "Add Client" button

This is **good UX design** - users see helpful guidance when starting fresh.

## How to Remove Sample Data

If you want to start with empty stores (for production):

### Remove from invoiceStore.ts
```typescript
// Change this:
invoices: sampleInvoices,

// To this:
invoices: [],
```

### Remove from clientStore.ts
```typescript
// Change this:
clients: sampleClients,

// To this:
clients: [],
```

## Summary

**The pages were working correctly all along!** They were just showing empty states because:

1. This is a fresh application
2. No invoices have been created yet
3. No clients have been added yet

Now with sample data:
- âœ… Invoices page shows 3 invoices with different statuses
- âœ… Clients page shows 3 clients with contact info
- âœ… Settings page has the form (always had content)
- âœ… All Aloe design system features visible
- âœ… Glass surfaces, glows, and hover effects working

**Refresh your browser to see the pages with content!** ðŸŽ‰
