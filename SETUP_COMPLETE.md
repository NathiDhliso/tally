## Available Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start dev server (http://localhost:5173)

# Building
npm run build            # Build for production
npm run preview          # Preview production build

# Code Quality
npm run lint             # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix         # Fix ESLint issues
npm run format           # Format with Prettier
npm run format:check     # Check formatting
```

## Next Steps

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your environment variables
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Begin implementing the next task from the spec

## Verification

✓ TypeScript compilation successful
✓ Production build successful
✓ ESLint passing (4 minor warnings in infrastructure code)
✓ All project folders created
✓ Git hooks configured

## Notes

- Pre-commit hooks will automatically lint and format your code
- Dark mode support is configured but not yet implemented in components
- The project uses Tailwind CSS v4 with the new `@import "tailwindcss"` syntax
