# Single-Page Architecture Implementation

## Overview
We've transformed the Voice to Invoice app from a traditional multi-page application into an **innovative single-page experience** where the invoice review slides in seamlessly instead of navigating away. This creates a fluid, conversational interface that feels like working with an AI companion.

---

## What Changed

### Before: Traditional Multi-Page Flow
1. User records voice on HomePage
2. Navigate to `/invoice/review` (separate page)
3. Review and edit invoice
4. Navigate to `/invoices` (another page)

**Problems:**
- Jarring page transitions break the flow
- Microphone disappears when reviewing
- Feels like separate disconnected tools
- Context is lost between pages

### After: Unified Single-Page Experience
1. User records voice on HomePage
2. **Microphone shrinks to corner** (stays visible)
3. **Invoice review slides up from bottom** (same page)
4. User can **swipe down or click microphone** to dismiss
5. Seamless transition to invoices list

**Benefits:**
- Smooth, animated transitions
- Microphone always accessible
- Feels like one cohesive experience
- AI companion guides you through states
- Gesture-based navigation (swipe to dismiss)

## Architecture

### State Machine
The app now uses a simple state machine with 4 states:

```typescript
type AppState = 'idle' | 'reviewing' | 'previewing' | 'complete';
```

**State Transitions:**
- `idle` → `reviewing`: Voice recording completes or manual entry
- `reviewing` → `previewing`: Form submitted
- `previewing` → `complete`: Invoice approved
- `reviewing` → `idle`: User dismisses (swipe down or click microphone)
- `complete` → navigate to `/invoices`

### Key Components

#### 1. HomePageUnified (`src/pages/HomePageUnified.tsx`)
The new unified homepage that manages all states internally.

**Features:**
- State machine for app flow
- Animated transitions between states
- Microphone shrinks to corner when reviewing
- Invoice review panel slides in from bottom
- Swipe gesture support for dismissal

#### 2. useSwipeGesture Hook (`src/hooks/useSwipeGesture.ts`)
Custom hook for detecting swipe gestures on touch and desktop.

**Features:**
- Touch event support (mobile)
- Mouse event support (desktop testing)
- Configurable threshold and velocity
- Returns swipe state (direction, distance, isSwiping)
- Supports all 4 directions (up, down, left, right)

## Implementation Details

### Animated Transitions

#### Microphone Shrink Animation
When transitioning from `idle` to `reviewing`:

```typescript
// Full-screen hero exits by shrinking to top-left
exit={{ 
  opacity: 0, 
  scale: 0.3,
  y: -window.innerHeight * 0.4,
  x: -window.innerWidth * 0.35,
  transition: { duration: 0.6, ease: [0.32, 0.72, 0, 1] }
}}

// Mini microphone appears in top-left corner
initial={{ 
  opacity: 0, 
  scale: 0.3,
  y: -window.innerHeight * 0.4,
  x: -window.innerWidth * 0.35
}}
animate={{ 
  opacity: 1, 
  scale: 1,
  y: 0,
  x: 0,
  transition: { duration: 0.6, ease: [0.32, 0.72, 0, 1], delay: 0.2 }
}}
```

#### Review Panel Slide-In
The invoice review panel slides up from the bottom:

```typescript
initial={{ y: '100%' }}
animate={{ 
  y: swipeState.isSwiping && swipeState.direction === 'down' 
    ? Math.min(swipeState.distance, window.innerHeight * 0.5)
    : 0 
}}
exit={{ y: '100%' }}
transition={{ duration: swipeState.isSwiping ? 0 : 0.5, ease: [0.32, 0.72, 0, 1] }}
```

**Key Details:**
- Follows finger/mouse during swipe
- Snaps back if swipe doesn't meet threshold
- Dismisses if swipe exceeds threshold
- Smooth easing for natural feel

### Gesture Support

#### Swipe to Dismiss
Users can swipe down on the review panel to dismiss it:

```typescript
const swipeState = useSwipeGesture(reviewPanelRef, {
  onSwipeDown: handleDismissReview,
  threshold: 100,        // Minimum 100px to trigger
  velocityThreshold: 0.5, // Or fast enough velocity
});
```

**Works on:**
- Mobile (touch events)
- Desktop (mouse drag)
- Trackpad (mouse drag)

#### Click Microphone to Dismiss
The minimized microphone in the corner acts as a "back" button:

```typescript
<motion.button
  onClick={handleDismissReview}
  className="w-16 h-16 rounded-full bg-gradient-to-br from-sage-500 to-gold-500"
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }}
  whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}
  title="Back to microphone"
>
  {/* Microphone icon */}
</motion.button>
```

## File Structure

```
src/
├── pages/
│   ├── HomePage.tsx              # Original multi-page version (kept for reference)
│   ├── HomePageUnified.tsx       # NEW: Single-page version ⭐
│   ├── InvoiceReviewPage.tsx     # Legacy route (backwards compatibility)
│   └── index.ts                  # Exports both versions
├── hooks/
│   └── useSwipeGesture.ts        # NEW: Swipe gesture detection ⭐
└── App.tsx                       # Updated to use HomePageUnified
```

---

## Migration Guide

### Switching Between Versions

**To use the new single-page experience (default):**
```typescript
// src/App.tsx
import { HomePageUnified } from './pages';

<Route index element={<HomePageUnified />} />
```

**To revert to the old multi-page version:**
```typescript
// src/App.tsx
import { HomePage } from './pages';

<Route index element={<HomePage />} />
<Route path="invoice/review" element={<InvoiceReviewPage />} />
```

### Backwards Compatibility
The `/invoice/review` route is kept for backwards compatibility. If users have bookmarked it or external links point to it, it will still work.

## User Experience Flow

### Desktop Experience

1. **Idle State**
   - Large microphone in center
   - "Voice to Invoice" hero headline
   - Quick actions below

2. **Recording**
   - Microphone pulses with audio level
   - Waveform visualizer appears
   - Timer shows duration

3. **Processing**
   - "Alright, I've got everything. Let me draft that invoice for you..."
   - Microphone shrinks to top-left corner
   - Review panel slides up from bottom

4. **Reviewing**
   - Minimized microphone visible in corner (click to dismiss)
   - Invoice form with confidence indicators
   - Low-confidence fields auto-focused
   - Swipe down indicator at top

5. **Dismissing**
   - Click microphone icon OR
   - Drag/swipe down on panel
   - Panel slides down, microphone expands back to center

### Mobile Experience

1. **Idle State**
   - Same as desktop, optimized for touch

2. **Recording**
   - Same as desktop

3. **Processing**
   - Same as desktop

4. **Reviewing**
   - Swipe down gesture is primary dismissal method
   - Visual indicator: "Swipe down to dismiss"
   - Microphone icon as secondary option

5. **Dismissing**
   - Natural swipe-down gesture
   - Follows finger during swipe
   - Snaps back if not swiped far enough

## Performance Considerations

### Lazy Loading
Heavy components are lazy-loaded to keep initial bundle small:

```typescript
const PDFPreviewModal = lazy(() => import('../components/PDFPreviewModal'));
const AloeBloom = lazy(() => import('../components/AloeBloom').then(m => ({ default: m.AloeBloom })));
```

### Animation Performance
- Uses `transform` and `opacity` for GPU acceleration
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Smooth 60fps animations on modern devices

### Memory Management
- State is cleared when dismissing review
- Event listeners properly cleaned up in useSwipeGesture
- No memory leaks from gesture handlers

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

**Desktop:**
- [ ] Microphone shrinks smoothly when reviewing
- [ ] Click microphone icon to dismiss
- [ ] Mouse drag down to dismiss (for testing swipe)
- [ ] Review panel slides in/out smoothly
- [ ] No layout shifts or jank

**Mobile:**
- [ ] Touch recording works
- [ ] Swipe down to dismiss review panel
- [ ] Swipe follows finger smoothly
- [ ] Snaps back if swipe is too short
- [ ] Dismisses if swipe is far enough
- [ ] No scroll conflicts

**Edge Cases:**
- [ ] Works with reduced motion enabled
- [ ] Works on small screens (320px width)
- [ ] Works on large screens (4K)
- [ ] Works with keyboard navigation
- [ ] Works with screen readers

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run existing tests (they should still pass)
npm test

# Test the new swipe gesture hook
npm test -- useSwipeGesture
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Horizontal Swipe Navigation**
   - Swipe left: Go to invoices list
   - Swipe right: Go to clients list
   - Requires updating useSwipeGesture to handle multiple directions

2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - `Esc`: Dismiss review panel
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + K`: Command palette
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`: Submit form

3. **Multi-Step Review**
   - Break form into multiple steps
   - Swipe left/right to navigate steps
   - Progress indicator at top

4. **Voice Commands**
   - "Go back" to dismiss
   - "Submit" to approve
   - "Edit [field name]" to focus field

5. **Haptic Feedback**
   - Vibrate on swipe threshold reached
   - Vibrate on successful dismissal
   - Requires Vibration API

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Swipe doesn't work on desktop
**Solution:** Use mouse drag instead. Click and drag down on the review panel.

### Issue: Microphone doesn't shrink smoothly
**Solution:** Check if `prefers-reduced-motion` is enabled. Animations are disabled for accessibility.

### Issue: Review panel doesn't dismiss
**Solution:** 
1. Check swipe distance (must be > 100px)
2. Check swipe velocity (must be > 0.5 px/ms)
3. Try clicking the microphone icon instead

### Issue: Layout shifts when transitioning
**Solution:** Ensure `overflow-x-hidden` is set on the container and `position: fixed` is used for the review panel.
