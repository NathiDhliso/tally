- Notification bell with gradient badge (showing "3")
- User avatar with sage-to-gold gradient
- Responsive design (shows logo on mobile, search on desktop)
- All buttons have scale animations on interaction

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Used
- `framer-motion` - For smooth animations and layout transitions
- `useReducedMotion` hook - For accessibility compliance

### Key Animation Patterns
1. **Layout Animations**: Used `layoutId` for smooth transitions of active indicators
2. **Hover Effects**: Scale and translate animations on navigation items
3. **Tap Feedback**: Scale down animations for tactile feedback
4. **Icon Animations**: Wiggle/scale animations for active states
5. **Expand Animations**: Width/opacity animations for search bar

### Glassmorphism Implementation
- Background: `bg-white/10` with `backdrop-blur-xl`
- Borders: `border-white/20` for subtle definition
- Hover states: `hover:bg-white/10` for interactive feedback
- Shadows: `shadow-glow` and `shadow-lift` for depth

### Aloe Color Integration
- **Sage Green**: Primary navigation color (`text-sage-400`)
- **Gold**: Accent color in gradients (`to-gold-500`)
- **Terracotta**: Used in notification badge (`from-terracotta-500`)
- **Gradients**: Sage-to-gold gradients for active states and branding

## Accessibility Features
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` setting
- Proper ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- Large touch targets (56px) on mobile
- Keyboard navigation support through Link components
- Sufficient color contrast for text

## Responsive Design
- **Desktop (lg+)**: 
  - Fixed sidebar on left (264px width)
  - Top bar spans remaining width
  - Content area adjusted with `lg:pl-64`
  
- **Mobile (<lg)**:
  - Top bar shows logo and actions
  - Floating bottom navigation bar
  - Content area has padding for both top and bottom bars

## Visual Enhancements
1. **Desktop Sidebar**:
   - Glass surface with blur
   - Smooth hover animations
   - Gradient active state
   - Animated indicator dot
   - Icon wiggle on active

2. **Mobile Navigation**:
   - Floating rounded bar
   - Large touch targets
   - Gradient active background
   - Scale animations on tap

3. **Top Bar**:
   - Minimal glass design
   - Expandable search
   - Animated notification badge
   - Gradient user avatar

## Requirements Satisfied
- ✅ 6.1: Glass surface with blur effect on desktop sidebar
- ✅ 6.2: Smooth hover effects for navigation items
- ✅ 6.3: Active state with sage-to-gold gradient highlight
- ✅ 6.4: Floating glass bottom bar on mobile (rounded, elevated)
- ✅ 6.5: Large touch targets (56px) with animated states
- ✅ 6.6: Minimal glass top bar with user avatar
- ✅ 6.7: Search with expand animation
- ✅ 6.8: Notification bell with badge animation

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test navigation on various screen sizes
2. Verify touch targets on mobile devices
3. Test with `prefers-reduced-motion` enabled
4. Verify smooth transitions between routes
5. Test search expand/collapse functionality
6. Verify notification badge visibility
7. Test keyboard navigation

## Next Steps
The navigation system is now complete with the Aloe design system. The next task in the implementation plan is:
- **Task 11**: Polish remaining pages (InvoicesPage, ClientsPage, SettingsPage)

## Notes
- All animations respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` setting
- The layout uses Framer Motion's `layoutId` for smooth shared element transitions
- Glass effects use CSS backdrop-filter for modern browsers
- The design maintains consistency with the Aloe theme throughout
- Mobile navigation is positioned to avoid interfering with content (floating with margin)
