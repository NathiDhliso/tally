### Key Features Implemented

1. **Aloe Color System**: Complete color palette inspired by South African Aloe plant
   - Sage green (stability, primary actions)
   - Terracotta (success, reserves)
   - Warm gold (highlights, accents)
   - Deep space backgrounds

2. **Glassmorphism**: Comprehensive glass surface utilities
   - Multiple variants (card, button, modal, input, nav, toast)
   - Tinted variants (sage, terracotta, gold)
   - Fallback support for older browsers

3. **Animations**: Rich animation system
   - Breathing, shimmer, glow-pulse, geometric-ripple, bloom, float
   - Configurable easings and durations
   - Accessibility support (prefers-reduced-motion)

4. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing code continues to work
   - Legacy color mappings preserved
   - Legacy animation classes maintained
   - Gradual migration path available

### Files Modified/Created

**Modified:**
- `tailwind.config.js` - Extended with Aloe design system
- `src/index.css` - Added CSS variables and utility classes
- `src/theme/index.ts` - Rewrote with new exports

**Created:**

### Next Steps

Ready to proceed with **Task 2: Create animation utilities and hooks**
- Install framer-motion
- Create Framer Motion utilities
- Create custom hooks (useReducedMotion, useParallax, use3DTransform)

### Testing Notes

- All files pass TypeScript diagnostics
- No compilation errors
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Ready for component implementation
